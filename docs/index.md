Documentation is split into different sections.

{: .warning}
LOVR has very recently dropped its new 0.16 version, which has a lot of changes, both under the hood and for the user. 
The instructions here reference the older 0.15 version and its mechanisms. Be sure to use the correct docs on the [LOVR Page](https://lovr.org/docs/)
