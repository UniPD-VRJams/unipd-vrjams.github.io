# Welcome to the Official  Page for the UniPD VRJam!
Here youll find everything you need to get up to speed, to secure a spot in the event and to learn how to use the Framework.

Thanks to suport from the univeristy and our partners UDU and 

## First things first
Be aware that the event IA NOT where you will leanr Lua or setup the LOVR framework.
Support for installation and troubleshooting will be provided,  but is not a core objective of the event. Same with Lua, we're happy to hekp you learn how to do more advanced things, but basic understanding of the system is a **requirement**,  not an optional.

To reach that requirement we here provide as many resources as possible, form LOVR to Lua to GPU shaders to git, we're happy to help you, so that you can take the best out of your experience at the Jam!
