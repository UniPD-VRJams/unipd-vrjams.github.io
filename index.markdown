# Welcome to the Official Page for the UniPD VRJam!
We're organizing an upcoming event at UniPD, in collaboration with the DEI depatment and UDU, for students to learn, share and create in the field of VR!

Here you'll find everything you need to get up to speed, to secure a spot in the event and to learn how to use the Framework.

We'll be using the [LÃ–VR]({{page.LOVR}}) framework, an open source project to create responsive VR experiences for all VR devices. 
It support HTC, Oculus and Valve devices, both on Mobile and PCVR, without a need for high-end hardware

The event is non-profit; no prizes, competitions or judges, just learning and meeting new people.

For the event, you'll need to __Bring Your Own Device__, so a laptop and an HMD are almost mandatory. You can use the framework without a headset, but it's not an optimal experience.

You'll need some programming experience, but the technology uses the very user friendly Lua programming language. No need for pointers, memory management or other advanced tools.

{: .warning }
__Setting up the environment is NOT part of the event.__ To learn how to do that, consult the [Official Docs]({{page.LOVR-docs}}), the [Unofficial Docs](/docs/), ask us on [Telegram]({{page.telegram}}) or on the [Official Matrix](https://lovr.org/matrix) or the [Official Slack](https://lovr.org/slack)

The current target for the event is the second week of November, so get everything ready and get comfortable with the technology beforehand.

You will also have to join the [Telegram Group]({{page.telegram}}) to keep up to date with the event and interact with the admins and participants.
Some info might be available only there, so be sure to join!

## What are the requirements?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{: .mt-2 .mb-4}

As stated before, the event is a __Bring Your Own Device__, so a laptop and *(a friend with)* an HMD are a must.
You don't strictly need an HMD to use the framework, but it's hard to really understand the technology and how to use at its best without some real world feedback. You can absolutely share a headset between participants.

You'll also need some free time before the event to setup everything, and some programming experience. Lua is quite an easy language and we have compiled some materials on how to get up to speed with in [our docs](/docs/lua.md).

For reference, some experience with variables, loops and functions is a solid foundation for using the basics, object oriented programming experience might also be useful.

You can also use OpenGL for shading and C/C++ and the Android NDK to add libraries, but that's more advanced. 

Experience with ADB is also recommended if you'll be using an Android headset.


## When and where?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's still being worked on, but likely the 2nd week of November, at the DEI department.
