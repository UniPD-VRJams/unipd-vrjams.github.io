# Welcome to the Official Page for the UniPD VRJam!
Here you'll find everything you need to get up to speed, to secure a spot in the event and to learn how to use the Framework.
## What is this?
We're organizing an upcoming event at UniPD, in collaboration with the DEI depatment and UDU, for students to learn, share and create in the filed of VR!

We'll be using the [LÃ–VR]({{page.LOVR}}) framework, an open source project to create responsive VR experiences for all VR devices. 
It support HTC, Oculus, Valve, both on Mobile and PCVR, without a need for expensive Hardware

The event is non profit, no prizes, competitions or judges, just learning and meeting new people.

For the event, you'll need to __Bring Your Own Device__, so a laptop and *(a friend with)* a HMD are a must.
You'll need some programming experience, but the technology uses the very user friendly Luaprogramming lanigage. No need for pointers, memory management or other advanced tools.

Setting up the environment is NOT part of the event. To get all the support consult the [Official Docs]({{page.LOVR-docs}}), the [Unofficial Docs](/docs/) or ask us on [Telegram]({{page.telegram}})

### Requirements 

You'll want to brush up on your Lua, as the framework is scripted using that. It can also use OpenGL for shading and C/C++ and the Android NDK to add libraries, but that's more advanced. 
Experience with ADB is also recommended if you'll be using an Android headset.

LOVR has an internal VR engine to run if you prefer, wchih simulates hand inputs and suport keyboard and mouse, and does not require a high end machine. It's just not the same. Useful to see if the code runs and acts as expected, but not for the finer details of the experience.

Learn more about it in the [Official Documentation]({{page.LOVR-docs}}) and our version 

### When and where?
That's still being worked on, but likely 1st-2nd week of November, at the DEI department.
